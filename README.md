| Sr.no | Algo/DS | time | playground | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Linear Search | O(n) | https://pl.kotl.in/O8DYwRIwi | well suited for small set of data and can have any arrangement |
| 2 | Binary Search | O(log(n)) | https://pl.kotl.in/O8DYwRIwi | works well with large data set but required the data to be already sorted in increasing order |
| 3 | Bubble Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | https://pl.kotl.in/9QCpQ4PzY | not ideal for large set of data as no. of comparisons and swaps are much more |
| 4 | Selection Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | https://pl.kotl.in/8eN_Ag7h- | same as bubble sort but has less no. of swaps |
| 5 | Insertion Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | https://pl.kotl.in/QJezxjTTp | Run time is same as that of Selection and Bubble but runs twice as fast as Bubble sort and somewhat better then Selection sort in ideal conditions and forms the basis for more advance sorting algo. |
