| Sr.no | Algo/DS | time | playground | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | -- | -- |
| 1 | Linear Search | O(n) | https://pl.kotl.in/O8DYwRIwi | well suited for small set of data and can have any arrangement |
| 2 | Binary Search | O(log(n)) | https://pl.kotl.in/O8DYwRIwi | works well with large data set but required the data to be already sorted in increasing order |
| 3 | Bubble Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | https://pl.kotl.in/9QCpQ4PzY | not ideal for large set of data as no comparisons and swaps are much more |
| 4 | Selection Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | https://pl.kotl.in/Qs2MuhwW- | same as bubble sort but has less no of swaps |
